### Welcome to JianYang Lab!
We are a team of researchers focused on understanding genomic variation and its impact on human health. Our work involves developing advanced statistical methods to analyze genetic and omics data from large cohorts, with the aim of improving the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of complex diseases.

Our research areas include genomic variation and population health, molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases, genomic risk prediction, cancer genomics, and the development of bioinformatics tools.
